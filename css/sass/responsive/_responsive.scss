Siren Framework v3.3

File Name: Responsive

File Purpose: Media query calls go here

File Notes: 
	- All media queries should got here
	- User comment heads to keep track of what you're styling
	- Media query breakpoints should be based on what makes the content look best and not device sizes
	- However, device sizes can help in understanding who will see what; for instance the example media query is set for right after tablets
